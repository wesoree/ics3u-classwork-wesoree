**Intent for this project:**
I decided to create this repo to share some projects, python-related software, along with development of my first bit of Python software which could help with reverting vandalism on Wikipedia. 
**games**
I have decided to create certain things, such as webdriver torso, which is kinda incomplete, which would need that bottom text that has aqua.flv on it, which is one of the things I wish to do on the bottom of the page, a dvd screensaver, and space invaders related things.

I had to create a codespace since I found out that school computers did not let me be able to download the necessary coding apps (VScode, Python, Git Bash, and Github Desktop). School Computers do not allow me to clone repos as fast as possible, since cloning a repo takes hours on those computers, due to them being slow. As soon as I found out about codespaces, I created one, since replit is kinda wierd, it creates unnecessary files that need to be deleted.
